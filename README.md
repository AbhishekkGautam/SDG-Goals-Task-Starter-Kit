# Assignment 1 : SDG Dashboard

Statement : You are provided with the last 3 years SDG Goals data. You are required to build a small visualisation dashboard for SDG goals, with the help of a chart and map (BONUS - optional).

## What you have to achieve -

- Use SDG data and visualise it on a chart and/or map (for ref - https://sdgindiaindex.niti.gov.in/)
- Enable two selectors - “Select Goals” and “Select Year”
- Based on the selected goal and year visualise a “bar chart”
- X-Axis - All Indian States/UT name (Make a toggle to show State/UT at a time)
- Y-Axis - Selected goal score for the selected year
- Keep the current state in the URL
- Store the three years data inside Redux.
- Improve CSS a little bit.

## Technologies Used:

1. HTML/CSS
2. React
3. ContextAPI + useReducer() hook = Redux
4. d3.js (for chart);
5. useSearchParams hook & useNavigate hook from react-router-dom to store state values in the URL.
